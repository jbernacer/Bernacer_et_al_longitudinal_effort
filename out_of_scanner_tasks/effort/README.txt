This folder includes individual results of the out-of-scanner task to assess effort-discounting.

Separate files for before (PRE) and after (POST) habit acquisition are included.

There are 19 subjects who finished the 3-month physical activity plan, and 13 "control" subjects
who were assessed approximately 3 months after the first evaluation.

The task included a fixed option (5 â‚¬ in exchange for 0 minutes running) and an alternative option.
For each subject, it was run in two consecutive sessions with 72 trials each. Note that the order of the
trials is randomized in each session and subject.

Files are Matlab cells organized as follows:

all_sessions{1,1}=1st session, money of the alternative option
all_sessions{2,1}=2nd session, money of the alternative option
all_sessions{1,2}=1st session, effort (minutes running) of the alternative option
all_sessions{2,2}=2nd session, effort (minutes running) of the alternative option
all_sessions{1,3}=1st session, position on screen of the alternative option
all_sessions{2,3}=2nd session, position on screen of the alternative option
all_sessions{1,4}=1st session, choice
all_sessions{2,4}=2nd session, choice
