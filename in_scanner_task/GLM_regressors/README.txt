This folder contains the txt files that defines the regressors for the fMRI analyses.
In FSL, regressors are generally defined by txt files with 3 columns:
1) Onset of the event
2) Duration (2 s in this case)
3) Parametric modulator, if any (1 for boxcar)

Files are compressed with Winrar. Each package contains the 7 explanatory variables (regressors) included in the analyses,
for each session (3 sessions), subject (19) and evaluation time point (PRE and POST)
