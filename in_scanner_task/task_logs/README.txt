'Task logs' are the different stimuli presented in the fMRI task, with their onset and main attributes
(effort=minutes running, probability=probability of winning).
'Subjective value' are like 'task logs' including subjective values of each option, effort discounting
factors and risk discounting factors. This subjective valuation is calculated with a hyperbolic discounting
for effort and an exponential for risk.
In "whole sample", subjective valuation is estimated with the same set of value for all subjects and
time points: double exponential for effort, exponential for risk. This was used to build the fMRI regressors.
