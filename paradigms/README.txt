This folder contains all relevant files to execute the in-scanner and out-of-scanner tasks.
The out-of-scanner tasks are "effort_discounting_task.m" and "risk_discounting_task.m". They run together with "pilot_effort.dat" and
"pilot_probability.dat", respectively, which contains the effort or probability levels of the alternative (discounted) option (default
option is always 5â‚¬ with either no effort or no risk).

The in-scanner task has a dat file per subject.

All tasks are coded in Cogent 2000, which runs in Matlab.
